<h1 id="Title"> Green Spaghetti</h1>
<p>Green Spaghetti a very delicious creamy food that can become anyones favorite dish. It is one of my favorite dish for its one of the <b class="keywords">first foods I learned to cook with my mom.</b> <br> 
    It is also the <b class="keywords">main food that I grew up eating the most </b> and seeing it in parties. 
    <br><br> Green Spaghetti is normally eaten with breaded chicken on the side, the breaded chicken not only makes the dish even more delicious but helps release an amazing smell of bay leaves.  </p>
